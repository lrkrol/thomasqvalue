thomasqvalue implements a number of functions taken from and related to the
1963 publication by Thomas

    H. B. G. Thomas (1963), Communication theory and the constellation
    hypothesis of calculation, Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,
    15:3, 173-191, doi: 10.1080/17470216308416323
    
in which he postulates that a certain Q-value can represent the information
requirement of a given calculation. The proposed formula for calculating such
Q-values breaks a calculation down into single-digit sub-calculations, and
takes into account both the number of these single-digit calculations, and the
amount to which information is carried over to subsequent sub-calculations.

This implementation uses the "short" addition constellations suggested by
Thomas, and generalises the proposal made in the original paper by allowing
digits to be zero, which also means it can accept two numbers of different
length. Here, any calculation that involves only one non-zero digit is given
a Q-value of 0, taking into account the possibility of a previously carried 1.
This extends the range of possible Q-values down towards 0, and means that
e.g. Q[10 + 1] = 0, whereas Q[11 + 1] = 0.6. Although I believe this to be in
line with Thomas' argumentation, it may not be entirely in the original
spirit -- Thomas himself did exclude all zeros, so use with caution.

The subtraction procedure is implemented analogous to the addition procedure,
where the short constellation leaves out the final resulting digit, making
e.g. the first constellation for `11-2` to be `(1, 2, abs(1-2))`. This
appears to be what Thomas intended: for "... one-stage sums ... in which the
answer is not equal to the sum of the problem-digits, ... it is the answer
which should be omitted ..." Note that this causes an invariance with respect
to `d2` for sub-calculations that produce no carry, and an invariance with
respect to `d1` when a carry is produced. Because of this, I am personally not
entirely convinced this is correct, but Thomas does not discuss this.
Subtraction has also been extended to accept zeros, where a Q-value of 0 is
returned for each sub-calculation that subtracts 0, including the potential
carry. 

The multiplication procedure has not been generalised and still requires a
one-digit number for the first part of the calculation. Presumably,
generalisation requires a combination of multiplication and addition, but
this has not been discussed in the original paper.

Note that the probability of success of the get_calculation functions depends
on all of the given arguments: a small allowed range of Q-values, a mismatched
range of allowed numbers, and a small amount of trials may all result in
failure even though calculations in the requested range do exist.
